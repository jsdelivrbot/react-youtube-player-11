This project have been started with a copy of Stephen Grider's Repository named ReduxSimpleStarter, on github (https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter), then, according with its lectures in the course Modern 
React with Redux (sections 1 and 2), this project got bigger and become the React Youtube Player. 

Thank you Stephen Grider.

### About

This project was built with React and it is an youtube player. Our youtube player has a search bar, a player (to play the youtube videos) and a list of videos that is updated according with the term searched by the user. We are showing 5 videos into the list and the user can pick one to be performed into the player. 

This project was built to understand better how React works.

You can check the commits tab. I committed a snippet of code each time a lecture was completed. So, you can navigate through the commits and the check the commit description and the code differences.
